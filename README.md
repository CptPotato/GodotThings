# GodotThings
These are some of my snippets and other bits for the [Godot game engine](https://github.com/godotengine/godot). Note that I don't go into too much detail about how to set these things up properly, so some *general knowledge about shader programming and how they are used in Godot is expected*.

## Content
Thing | Description
--- | ---
[Smooth Pixel Filtering](SmoothPixelFiltering) | A shader snippet for "smooth pixelated" filtering, eliminating most aliasing artifacts.
[Procedural Checkerboard](ProceduralCheckerboard) | A spatial material useful for blocking out levels. It displays a checkerboard pattern along all axes.
[Color Grading](ColorGrading) | (work in progress) A simple post process shader that can be used for color grading.
